from the heights poem translated by la magnus
supposing that truth is a woman what then is there not ground
for suspecting that all philosophers in so far as they have been
dogmatists have failed to understand women that the terrible
seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid
their addresses to truth have been unskilled and unseemly methods for
winning a woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won and
at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien if
indeed it stands at all for there are scoffers who maintain that it
has fallen that all dogma lies on the ground nay more that it is at
its last gasp but to speak seriously there are good grounds for hoping
that all dogmatizing in philosophy whatever solemn whatever conclusive
and decided airs it has assumed may have been only a noble puerilism
and tyronism and probably the time is at hand when it will be once
and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such
imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have
hitherto reared perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time
such as the soul superstition which in the form of subject and
ego superstition has not yet ceased doing mischief perhaps some
play upon words a deception on the part of grammar or an
audacious generalization of very restricted very personal very
human all too human facts the philosophy of the dogmatists it is to
be hoped was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards as was
astrology in still earlier times in the service of which probably more
labour gold acuteness and patience have been spent than on any
actual science hitherto we owe to it and to its super terrestrial
pretensions in asia and egypt the grand style of architecture it seems
that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with
everlasting claims all great things have first to wander about the
earth as enormous and awe inspiring caricatures dogmatic philosophy has
been a caricature of this kind for instance the vedanta doctrine in
asia and platonism in europe let us not be ungrateful to it although
it must certainly be confessed that the worst the most tiresome
and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist
